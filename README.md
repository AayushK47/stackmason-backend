## Installation

To set up **Stackmason** locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stackmason.git
   cd stackmason
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update environment-specific variables as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
   If your project includes a database, run migrations to set up tables:
   ```bash
   node ace migration:run
   ```

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run:

```bash
node ace serve --watch
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3333`. You can access the API or web application based on your setup.

## Configuration

AdonisJS uses `.env` files to manage configuration settings. Update `.env` to adjust database settings, API keys, and other environment-specific values.

## Usage

### Running the Application

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
node ace serve --watch
```

For production, ensure environment variables are set correctly, and start the application without `--watch` for improved performance.

### Running Tests

To execute tests, run:

```bash
node ace test
```
